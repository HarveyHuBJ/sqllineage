# Sql Lineage
In Data Governance topic, **data lineage** will act an important role on data quality, data security and data changes management. Here will show some lineage artifacts.

## Current State

Now we worked out a solution to parse Column-Level data lineage from **sql scripts**, that means when all ETL processes is realized by calling Stored Procedures, we can manage to extract column lineages from codes automatically.  Then the artifact will benefit data quality assurance, data security inspection and data changes impact evaluation, etc.

Please visit our demo site : [T-SQL Lineage Web Parser(Demo only, DO NOT use in prod)](https://lineagewebparser.azurewebsites.net/) to experience the lineage parsing. Feel free to change the script on the playground as you like. 

Or please visit our [Examples](./examples.md) file to have a quick understanding.
